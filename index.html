        <h3>absolute</h3>
        <p>
          An element with <code> position: absolute;</code> will ignore sibling
          elements and instead be positioned
          <strong class="highlight_1">
            relative to its closest parent element that is positioned with
            relative or absolute.
          </strong>
          The absolute value removes an element entirely from the document flow.
          By using the positioning attributes top, left, bottom and right, an
          element can be positioned anywhere as expected.

      <article class="fixed">
        <h3>fixed</h3>
        <p>
          When the CSS position has a value of fixed, it is set/pinned to a
          specific spot on a page.
          <strong class="highlight_1">
            The fixed element stays the same regardless of scrolling.
          </strong>
          The navigation bar is a great example of an element that is often set
          to position: fixed;, enabling the user to scroll through the web page
          and still access the navigation bar.
        </p>

      <article class="sticky">
        <h3>sticky</h3>
        <p>
          A sticky element toggles
          <strong class="highlight_1">between relative and fixed </strong> ,
          depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a
          given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in
          place (like <code>position:fixed </code>).

            a single game with 573, as well as being the first player to throw
            for six touchdowns three times. Stroud was a Heisman Trophy finalist
            in 2021 and 2022 and was selected by the Texans second overall in

            of the 2018 NFL Draft. Jackson became the Ravens' starting
            quarterback in his rookie season after an injury to incumbent Joe
            Flacco and clinched a division title with the team, also becoming
            the youngest NFL quarterback to start a playoff game at age 21.
